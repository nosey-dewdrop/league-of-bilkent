# How to Use — Squirrel

## What You Need

1. **Java JDK 17 or higher** — to compile and run the app
2. **MySQL 8.0 or higher** — the app stores all data in a MySQL database
3. **A terminal** — Terminal (Mac), Command Prompt or PowerShell (Windows)

### Check if you have them
```
java -version
javac -version
mysql --version
```

If any of these fail, install them first:
- Java: https://adoptium.net
- MySQL: https://dev.mysql.com/downloads/mysql/

## Step 1: Set Up the Database

Squirrel uses **MySQL** as its database. MySQL is a relational database — it stores data in tables with rows and columns. The app creates the following tables automatically on first run:

| Table | What it stores |
|-------|---------------|
| users | Usernames, emails, hashed passwords, bios, XP |
| events | Event title, description, location, dates, capacity |
| attendance | Who is Going/Interested/Maybe for each event |
| follows | Who follows whom |
| comments | Threaded comments under events |
| notifications | User notifications |
| messages | Direct messages between users |
| interests | User interest tags |
| tag_filters | Custom feed tag filters |

### Create the database

Open your terminal and run:
```
mysql -u root -p
```

Enter your MySQL root password when prompted. Then type:
```sql
CREATE DATABASE IF NOT EXISTS squirrel_db;
EXIT;
```

### Configure the connection

Open `model/AppConstants.java` and check these lines:
```java
public static final String DB_URL  = "jdbc:mysql://localhost:3306/squirrel_db";
public static final String DB_USER = "root";
public static final String DB_PASS = "";
```

If your MySQL root password is not empty, change `DB_PASS` to your password.

## Step 2: Compile

Navigate to the project folder in your terminal:
```
cd path/to/our_project_lastversion
```

Then compile all Java files:

**Mac / Linux:**
```
javac -cp ".:lib/*" model/*.java tools/*.java panels/*.java screens/*.java
```

**Windows:**
```
javac -cp ".;lib/*" model/*.java tools/*.java panels/*.java screens/*.java
```

You should see no errors. If you see errors about missing MySQL connector, make sure the `lib/` folder contains `mysql-connector-j.jar`.

---

## Step 3: Run

**Mac / Linux:**
```
java -cp ".:lib/*:model:panels:screens:tools" screens.MainFile
```

**Windows:**
```
java -cp ".;lib/*;model;panels;screens;tools" screens.MainFile
```

The login window will appear. On first run, the app automatically loads sample data (demo users, events, comments).

## Step 4: Log In

Use one of the demo accounts:

| Username | Password | Role |
|----------|----------|------|
| damla | 1234 | Student (CS & Event Organizer) |
| eylul | 1234 | Student (Art & Photography) |
| emir_selim | 1234 | Student (Sports Enthusiast) |
| ege | 1234 | Student (Music & GameDev) |
| bosman | 1234 | Student (Entrepreneur) |
| ieee_bilkent | 1234 | Club (IEEE Bilkent) |
| music_club | 1234 | Club (Music Club) |

Or click the **Register** tab to create your own account. Registration requires a Bilkent email address (@ug.bilkent.edu.tr or @bilkent.edu.tr). A verification code will be shown if email sending is not configured.

## Email Configuration (Optional)

Email verification works out of the box for testing — if email sending fails, the verification code is shown in a popup.

To enable real email sending, edit `credentials.properties`:
```
email.sender=your_email@gmail.com
email.password=your_app_password
email.smtp.host=smtp.gmail.com
email.smtp.port=587
```

For Gmail, you need to generate an App Password in your Google Account settings.

## Troubleshooting

| Problem | Solution |
|---------|----------|
| MySQL connection refused | Make sure MySQL is running: `brew services start mysql` (Mac) or `sudo systemctl start mysql` (Linux) |
| ClassNotFoundException for MySQL | Check that `lib/mysql-connector-j.jar` exists |
| Email not sending | This is normal for testing. The code is shown in a popup instead |
| Compile errors | Make sure you are in the project root folder, not inside a subfolder |
| Tables not created | The app creates tables automatically on first run via `Database.createConnection()` |
